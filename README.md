## Study Group Event Tracker

A series of scripts to pull "event" data from [Mozilla Study Groups](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup), or informal peer learning groups organized around Github pages sites with a Jekyll Theme. In this case, "events" means 

Study Group Leaders fork the [Study Group repo](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup) to start their own website, and use github issues and `_posts` to populate events on their sites. Events can be anything from informal hacky hours to structured workshops taught by peers, often dabbling in scientific or statistical programming topics. Read more about Study Groups in the [Study Group Orientation Guide](https://mzl.la/sg-orientation).

$ NODE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> node index.js
```

#### Flow and Requirements

Flow:

- Get all forks from:
    `https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup`
- From each fork, list all files inside:
    `https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup/tree/gh-pages/_posts` from github-pages branch
- Download/request each file and parse to create json object (graymatter)

Requirements:

- It should recover from crashes
- It should run x times a month

TODO:

- Handle errors
- Ignore forks that did not create new events

#### MERGED DATA FROM ALL GROUPS

To run the script: 

Goes to /data and execute: 

```
$ python join_json.py

```
It will generate a new json file in current folder. 

p.s. the script only will works if the json for in the specific format. (see entry parsed)


#### Flow

- Get all the folders in /data 
- In every folder , it takes each json file and concatenate each other. 
- The outcome of script, ```merge_files.json" ```, it's a json file with every information of jsons in /data. 
- merge_files.json are at /data. 

#### Requirements 

- It should always run after the crawler. 

#### TO DO 

-- Ignore default jsons
